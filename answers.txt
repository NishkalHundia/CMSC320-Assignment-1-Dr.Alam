Q1: Why might be consider using git?

Answer: I think git is a very powerful version control tool that allows multiple collaborators to effectively 
manage their contributions to a project. Git allows us to keep track of all the changes that were made, merge changes
easily and allows very easy reverting options in case something goes wrong with the code.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give and Example and how it might help

Answer: Data science could be applied to a lot of fields. Fields such as politics hugely benefit from data science
as when running polls where millions of people respond, it can be very difficult to manually sort through the
reponses. Here data science can help gain valuable insights into the information that was collected via the polls.

Q3: What is the difference between merging and rebasing?

Answer: Git rebase creates a new set of commits applied on top of the target branch, while git merge creates a 
new merge commit that combines the changes from both brances.
