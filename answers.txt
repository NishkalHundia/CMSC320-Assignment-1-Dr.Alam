Q1: Why might be consider using git?

Answer: I think git is a very powerful version control tool that allows multiple collaborators to effectively 
manage their contributions to a project. Git allows us to keep track of all the changes that were made, merge changes
easily and allows very easy reverting options in case something goes wrong with the code.
