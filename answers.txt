Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give and Example and how it might help

Answer: Data science could be applied to a lot of fields. Fields such as politics hugely benefit from data science
as when running polls where millions of people respond, it can be very difficult to manually sort through the
reponses. Here data science can help gain valuable insights into the information that was collected via the polls.
